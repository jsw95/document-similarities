One way in which the glove data falls down is that it does not have word emebddings for certain wairds such as brexit., and can therefore not utilise the meaning of these words, where the others can. 
First methods do not take into account frequency of words in language, therefore words such as will, will skew your resut1ls more than divorce.

One area where improvements could be made is reducing the amount of time it takes to retreive the word embeddings from the file.
Assuming we dont want to load the whole 1,900,000 rows into a memeory as a hash table, then mulitprocessing could be used to
increase speed. This was attempted but I was unable to utilise the multiprocessing without loading the whole dataaset into memory.
